# Direwolf20-1.7.10-Hotfixes
Because someone thought it was a great idea to throw 150 mods together and hope for the best.


MachineMuse on DW20 1.7.10 (v1.10) is just straight up broken. And the fixes are just not working. So, delete all the recipes under ./config/machinemuse/recipes and then add the "unfuckMachineMuse.zs" to the ./scripts/ folder in the root DW20 directory. Viola, working Power Armor Suits & materials.
