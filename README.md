# Direwolf20 1.7.10 Hotfixes
Because someone thought it was a great idea to throw 150 mods together and hope for the best.


#Files
Here's a list of the files in this repo and what they do.

##unfuckMachineMuse.zs
MachineMuse on DW20 1.7.10 (v1.10) is just straight up broken. And the fixes are just not working. So, delete all the recipes under ./config/machinemuse/recipes and then add the "unfuckMachineMuse.zs" to the ./scripts/ folder in the root DW20 directory. Viola, working Power Armor Suits & materials.

##unstableTinkerRecipes.zs
The ability to cast Unstabled Induced items is broken in DW20 1.7.10 (v1.10) due to a bug with Extra Utilities. Add this script to the ./scripts/ folder in your root DW20 directory. Viola, working recipes for Unstable Induced pickaxes, etc!
